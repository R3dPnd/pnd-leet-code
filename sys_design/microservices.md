# Microservices Interview Study Guide

## Overview
Microservices architecture is a fundamental concept for modern cloud-native applications and is crucial for the Axon Senior Software Engineer role. This guide covers the essential concepts, patterns, challenges, and interview questions you'll encounter.

## Core Microservices Concepts

### 1. What are Microservices?
- **Definition**: Small, independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs
- **Characteristics**: Single responsibility, independent deployment, technology diversity
- **Benefits**: Scalability, fault isolation, technology flexibility, team autonomy
- **Drawbacks**: Distributed system complexity, network latency, data consistency challenges

### 2. Microservices vs Monoliths
- **Monolith**: Single codebase, shared database, easier deployment, harder scaling
- **Microservices**: Distributed codebase, separate databases, complex deployment, easier scaling
- **When to Use**: Consider team size, system complexity, scalability requirements

## Microservices Architecture Patterns

### 1. Service Communication
- **Synchronous**: REST APIs, gRPC, GraphQL
- **Asynchronous**: Message queues (RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka), event-driven patterns
- **Service Mesh**: Istio, Linkerd for service-to-service communication management

### 2. Data Management
- **Database per Service**: Each service owns its data, no shared databases
- **Saga Pattern**: Distributed transactions across multiple services
- **Event Sourcing**: Store events instead of state for audit and replay
- **CQRS**: Separate read and write models for different use cases

### 3. Service Discovery & Registration
- **Service Registry**: Eureka, Consul, etcd
- **Load Balancing**: Round-robin, least connections, weighted distribution
- **Health Checks**: Liveness and readiness probes for service health

### 4. API Gateway Pattern
- **Purpose**: Single entry point, authentication, rate limiting, routing
- **Implementation**: Kong, AWS API Gateway, Azure API Management
- **Benefits**: Centralized cross-cutting concerns, simplified client communication

## Common Interview Questions & Answers

### 1. "How do you handle data consistency across microservices?"

**Answer Structure:**
- **Eventual Consistency**: Accept temporary inconsistency for better performance
- **Saga Pattern**: Use compensating transactions for rollbacks
- **Two-Phase Commit**: For strong consistency (but higher latency)
- **Event Sourcing**: Replay events to rebuild state

**Example**: "For an e-commerce system, I'd use eventual consistency with the Saga pattern. When placing an order, I'd create a saga that coordinates inventory reservation, payment processing, and order confirmation. If any step fails, compensating transactions roll back the previous steps."

### 2. "How do you handle service failures and implement circuit breakers?"

**Answer Structure:**
- **Circuit Breaker States**: Closed (normal), Open (failing), Half-Open (testing)
- **Fallback Strategies**: Default responses, cached data, degraded functionality
- **Implementation**: Hystrix, Resilience4j, or custom implementation

**Example**: "I'd implement a circuit breaker that opens after 5 consecutive failures. When open, it returns cached data or a default response. After a timeout, it moves to half-open to test if the service has recovered."

### 3. "How do you design microservices for scalability?"

**Answer Structure:**
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Stateless services, load balancing, auto-scaling
- **Database Scaling**: Read replicas, sharding, caching
- **Async Processing**: Message queues for heavy operations
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis, CDN, application-level caching

**Example**: "I'd design stateless services that can be horizontally scaled. Use Redis for session storage, implement read replicas for databases, and use message queues for heavy processing tasks like image resizing or report generation."

### 4. "How do you handle distributed tracing and monitoring?"

**Answer Structure:**
- **Distributed Tracing**: Jaeger, Zipkin, AWS X-Ray
- **Correlation IDs**: Pass request IDs across service boundaries
- **Metrics Collection**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack
- **Alerting**: Set thresholds for response times, error rates, throughput

**Example**: "I'd implement distributed tracing with correlation IDs that flow through all services. Use Jaeger for tracing visualization and Prometheus for metrics collection. Set up alerts for 95th percentile response times exceeding 500ms."

### 5. "How do you handle API versioning in microservices?"

**Answer Structure:**
- **URL Versioning**: `/api/v1/users`, `/api/v2/users`
- **Header Versioning**: `Accept: application/vnd.company.app-v1+json`
- **Query Parameter**: `?version=1`
- **Content Negotiation**: Different response formats based on Accept header

**Example**: "I prefer header-based versioning as it keeps URLs clean. I'd support multiple versions simultaneously during transitions, with clear deprecation policies communicated to API consumers."

## Advanced Microservices Topics

### 1. Event-Driven Architecture
- **Event Sourcing**: Store events instead of state
- **CQRS**: Separate read and write models
- **Event Store**: Apache Kafka, EventStore, AWS EventBridge
- **Benefits**: Audit trail, temporal queries, scalability

### 2. Service Mesh
- **Purpose**: Handle service-to-service communication
- **Components**: Data plane (sidecar proxies), control plane
- **Features**: Load balancing, service discovery, security, observability
- **Implementations**: Istio, Linkerd, Consul Connect

### 3. Container Orchestration
- **Kubernetes**: Pod management, service discovery, auto-scaling
- **Docker Swarm**: Simpler alternative to Kubernetes
- **Benefits**: Automated deployment, scaling, health monitoring

### 4. Security in Microservices
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens, OAuth 2.0, API keys
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Network Security**: mTLS, service mesh security policies
- **Secrets Management**: HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager

## Design Patterns for Microservices

### 1. Aggregator Pattern
- **Purpose**: Combine data from multiple services
- **Use Case**: Dashboard that shows data from user, order, and inventory services
- **Implementation**: API Gateway or dedicated aggregator service

### 2. Proxy Pattern
- **Purpose**: Route requests to appropriate services
- **Use Case**: API Gateway that routes based on request type
- **Benefits**: Centralized routing, load balancing, security

### 3. Chained Pattern
- **Purpose**: Sequential service calls
- **Use Case**: Order processing that goes through validation → payment → inventory → notification
- **Considerations**: Latency, error handling, timeout management

### 4. Branch Pattern
- **Purpose**: Parallel service calls
- **Use Case**: User profile that fetches data from multiple services simultaneously
- **Implementation**: Async calls with Promise.all or similar constructs

## Testing Strategies

### 1. Unit Testing
- **Scope**: Individual service methods
- **Tools**: JUnit, NUnit, pytest
- **Focus**: Business logic, edge cases, error handling

### 2. Integration Testing

- **Focus**: User experience, cross-service integration

## Deployment Strategies

### 1. Blue-Green Deployment
