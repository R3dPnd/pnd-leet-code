# Caching Levels Study Guide

## Overview
Caching is a fundamental technique for improving system performance, reducing latency, and decreasing load on backend systems. Understanding the different caching levels and when to use each is crucial for designing high-performance systems, especially for mission-critical applications like those at Axon.

## The Caching Hierarchy

### 1. L1 Cache (CPU Cache)
- **Location**: On the CPU chip
- **Size**: 32KB - 1MB
- **Speed**: Fastest (1-3 CPU cycles)
- **Purpose**: Store frequently accessed CPU instructions and data
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Split into instruction cache (L1i) and data cache (L1d)
  - Hardware-managed, transparent to software
  - Extremely fast but limited capacity

**Interview Example**: "L1 cache is the fastest memory in the system, located directly on the CPU. It's typically 32KB-1MB and can be accessed in 1-3 CPU cycles. This is where the CPU stores its most frequently used instructions and data."

### 2. L2 Cache
- **Location**: On the CPU chip (larger than L1)
- **Size**: 256KB - 8MB
- **Speed**: Fast (10-20 CPU cycles)
- **Purpose**: Bridge between L1 cache and main memory
- **Characteristics**:
  - Larger than L1 but slightly slower
  - Shared between CPU cores
  - Hardware-managed

### 3. L3 Cache
- **Location**: On the CPU chip (shared across cores)
- **Size**: 8MB - 32MB
- **Speed**: Moderate (40-75 CPU cycles)
- **Purpose**: Shared cache for all CPU cores
- **Characteristics**:
  - Largest on-chip cache
  - Shared across all CPU cores
  - Helps with inter-core communication

## Application-Level Caching

### 1. In-Memory Caching
- **Location**: Application process memory
- **Size**: Limited by available RAM
- **Speed**: Very fast (nanoseconds)
- **Purpose**: Store frequently accessed application data
- **Implementation**: 
  - Java: Caffeine, EhCache
  - Python: functools.lru_cache, Redis
  - Go: sync.Map, bigcache
  - .NET: MemoryCache, DistributedCache

**Interview Example**: "For application-level caching, I'd use an in-memory cache like Caffeine in Java or Redis for distributed scenarios. This stores frequently accessed data like user sessions, database query results, or computed values directly in the application's memory space."

### 2. Application Cache Patterns
- **Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading)**:
  - Check cache first, load from source if miss
  - Update cache after loading
  - Simple but can lead to cache stampede

- **Write-Through**:
  - Write to cache and source simultaneously
  - Ensures consistency but adds latency
  - Good for critical data

- **Write-Behind (Write-Back)**:
  - Write to cache first, batch writes to source
  - Better performance but risk of data loss
  - Use for non-critical, high-volume writes

- **Refresh-Ahead**:
  - Proactively refresh cache before expiration
  - Eliminates cache misses but uses more resources
  - Good for predictable access patterns

## Database-Level Caching

### 1. Query Result Cache
- **Location**: Database server memory
- **Size**: Limited by database server RAM
- **Speed**: Fast (microseconds)
- **Purpose**: Cache frequently executed queries
- **Implementation**:
  - MySQL: Query Cache (deprecated in 8.0)
  - PostgreSQL: Shared buffers, pg_stat_statements
  - Oracle: Result Cache, Buffer Cache
  - SQL Server: Plan Cache, Buffer Pool

**Interview Example**: "At the database level, I'd implement query result caching using PostgreSQL's shared buffers and potentially Redis for frequently accessed query results. This reduces database load and improves response times for repeated queries."

### 2. Connection Pooling
- **Location**: Application server
- **Size**: Configurable pool size
- **Speed**: Fast (microseconds)
- **Purpose**: Reuse database connections
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduces connection overhead
  - Limits concurrent connections
  - Improves response time

### 3. Database Buffer Pool
- **Location**: Database server memory
- **Size**: Large portion of available RAM
- **Speed**: Fast (microseconds)
- **Purpose**: Cache frequently accessed data pages
- **Characteristics**:
  - LRU eviction policy
  - Dirty page management
  - Write-back to disk

## Distributed Caching

### 1. Redis
- **Location**: Separate server(s) in network
- **Size**: Limited by available RAM
- **Speed**: Fast (sub-millisecond)
- **Purpose**: Shared cache across multiple application instances
- **Features**:
  - In-memory data structures
  - Persistence options (RDB, AOF)
  - Clustering and replication
  - Pub/sub messaging

**Interview Example**: "For distributed caching, I'd use Redis as it provides sub-millisecond response times and supports various data structures. I'd implement it with Redis Cluster for high availability and use Redis Sentinel for failover management."

### 2. Memcached
- **Location**: Separate server(s) in network
- **Size**: Limited by available RAM
- **Speed**: Fast (sub-millisecond)
- **Purpose**: Simple key-value caching
- **Characteristics**:
  - Simple key-value store
  - No persistence
  - Multi-threaded
  - Good for session storage

### 3. Hazelcast

- **Size**: Limited by cluster memory
- **Speed**: Fast (sub-millisecond)
- **Purpose**: Distributed in-memory computing
- **Features**:
  - In-memory data grid
  - Distributed computing
  - Event processing
  - Java-native

## CDN and Edge Caching

### 1. Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- **Location**: Geographically distributed edge servers
- **Size**: Large (terabytes)
- **Speed**: Fast (10-100ms)
- **Purpose**: Cache static content close to users
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduced latency
  - Lower origin server load
  - Global distribution
  - DDoS protection

**Interview Example**: "For global content delivery, I'd implement a CDN like CloudFront or Cloudflare to cache static assets like images, CSS, JavaScript, and videos. This reduces latency for users worldwide and decreases load on our origin servers."

### 2. Edge Computing
- **Location**: Edge servers close to users
- **Size**: Limited by edge server capacity
- **Speed**: Fast (10-50ms)
- **Purpose**: Process data closer to users
- **Use Cases**:
  - Real-time analytics
  - IoT data processing
  - Content personalization
  - Security filtering

### 3. CDN Caching Strategies
- **Cache-Control Headers**:
  - `max-age`: How long to cache
  - `no-cache`: Validate with origin before serving
  - `no-store`: Never cache
  - `must-revalidate`: Check freshness before serving

- **Cache Invalidation**:
  - Manual purging
  - Version-based URLs
  - Query parameters
  - Cache warming

## Browser and Client-Side Caching

## Interview Questions and Answers

### 1. "How would you design a multi-level caching strategy?"

**Answer Structure**:
- **L1**: Application-level in-memory cache (fastest, smallest)
- **L2**: Distributed cache like Redis (fast, shared)
- **L3**: CDN for static content (global, large)
- **L4**: Browser cache (user-local, fastest for user)

**Example**: "I'd implement a multi-level caching strategy starting with an in-memory cache in each application instance for frequently accessed data. Then a Redis cluster for shared data across instances, followed by a CDN for static assets, and finally leverage browser caching for user-specific content."

### 2. "How do you handle cache invalidation across multiple services?"

**Answer Structure**:
- **Event-Driven**: Publish invalidation events
- **Message Queue**: Use Kafka/RabbitMQ for events
- **Distributed Cache**: Redis pub/sub for coordination
- **Version-Based**: Include version in cache keys

**Example**: "I'd use an event-driven approach where services publish cache invalidation events to a message queue. All services subscribe to these events and invalidate their local caches accordingly. I'd also implement version-based caching as a fallback."

### 3. "What's your strategy for cache warming in a high-traffic system?"

**Answer Structure**:
- **Critical Path**: Warm most important data first
- **Predictive**: Use analytics to predict user behavior
- **Scheduled**: Warm during low-traffic periods
- **Progressive**: Warm data incrementally

**Example**: "I'd implement a multi-phase cache warming strategy. First, warm critical data like user authentication and core business logic during deployment. Then use analytics to predict and warm frequently accessed data. Finally, implement scheduled warming during off-peak hours."
