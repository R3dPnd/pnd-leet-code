- **Replication**: Master-slave, master-master, read replicas

### 4. High Availability & Fault Tolerance
- **Load Balancing**: Round-robin, least connections, weighted distribution
- **Failover Mechanisms**: Active-passive, active-active configurations
- **Health Checks**: Liveness and readiness probes
- **Auto-scaling**: Horizontal pod autoscaling, instance groups
- **Disaster Recovery**: Backup strategies, RTO/RPO objectives

### 5. Performance & Optimization
- **Caching Layers**: Application, database, CDN caching
- **Database Optimization**: Query optimization, connection pooling
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Background jobs, message queues

- **Consider Trade-offs**: Discuss pros/cons of different approaches
- **Think Scalability**: Always consider how the system grows
- **Security First**: Emphasize security for mission-critical systems

### 3. Common Interview Questions
- "How would you design a system that handles 1M+ concurrent users?"
- "What's your approach to ensuring 99.99% uptime?"
- "How do you handle data consistency across distributed systems?"
- "What monitoring and alerting would you implement?"

## Key Areas to Emphasize for Axon
